    <p>First blog</p>

    <p>This is my first post in this section. I don't even know what to talk about in here. A blog is supposedly a nice way to lay things down. Ah.</p>

    <p>So I have recently started learning blender. I should be able to make some simple assets with it out of what I've learned as of now. My next post should be about that.</p>

    <p>I have to complete some paperwork for college, and have to fill in random shit. I also have to make some payments. Nothing crazy, but it still sucks.</p>

    <p>Why the fuck is the paperwork to get into college more difficult than the exam. It doesn't make sense. Although I guess the exam itself does technically qualify as paperwork on its own.</p>

    <p>I also want to learn more recipes. Unfortunately, I'm not allowed near kitchens nor airplanes for unrelated reasons.</p>

    <p>I'm looking into modifying laptops. I should be able to attach some controller boards to the ports of potato laptops nobody wants. I could shove gentoo in there if it seems necessary.</p>

    <p>My potato laptop is something I won't touch. The last arch install I tried broke, mint sucks, manjaroo broke... I'm currently on endeavouros, I hope I don't break this one.</p>

    <p>Or maybe I should install gentoo in here. I don't know how many days it would take, but it would be funny.</p>

    <p>All things said, I've been looking into learning assembly on my own. It should be a fun ride. I think I will end up liking it.</p>

    <p>Update: I've liked it so far.</p>
