    <p>So I made a blog</p>

    <p>I booted up my computer, opened up neovim and started spouting nonsense out on my index file. I'm not entirely sure of what I'm doing if I'm being honest. I just wanted to have a place to write down the tasks I've got pending.</p>

    <p>

    In this case, I have multiple development projects to address, so I'll be listing them down now:

    </p>

    <ol>
      
      <li><a href="index.html">Update your blog at least once a week</a></li>

      <li><a href="#">Get into OS development</a></li>

      <li><a href="#">Complete that rancid game you haven't touched in a week</a></li>

    </ol>

<p>Those are the projects as of now. I'll be looking into ways to complete them throughout the week. And I'll be trying to make it as quick as possible.</p>

<p>I also need to look into ways to make money out of all this shit.</p>

<p>Well, it'll be almost impossible to make money out of all this, but it is still fun to do as a hobby.</p>

<p>Maybe I should try and work on commission. Hey, that sounds nice. I could try to work that way.</p>

<p>I could look into that. Y'know what? I will look into that. I want money.</p>

<p>Anyhow. I made this website. The file structure is absolute garbango, but I can't be bothered to make it better, as I don't expect other people to see it anyways, and it is easier to simply copy-paste files to fit a single theme than to put actual effort into managing your files.</p>

<p>I instead am managing these in codes. I'll have the html files numbered and classified to fit a singular standard.</p>

<p>The theme can also be changed to anything I want. So I've been thinking about changing it to warmer tones, as this theme is a tad shitty. Which is odd, as I hadn't considered it at first, but I was told by an art student that my theme is shit.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get some work done before having to spend time in family right now. I should be able to complete these at least.</p>
