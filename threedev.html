  <p>I've been learning</p>

  <p>C++ has never been my forte, but I have recently picked up the habit of practicing with it as a way to stir up more projects. I'm looking forward to using it for game development, as that sort of thing can easily catch the attention of my classmates overall.</p>

  <p>My objective here is to rally a bunch of people up to help with projects. It would certainly be a great way to start a student association, or maybe a company of my own. Now that I think about it, it sounds like the latter would bring in more benefits, although it could quickly turn into a messy situation thanks to my lack of funds. Nobody wants to work for free after all. </p>

  <p>A good solution would be to start working on small projects and seem accommodating enough for people to help me a little bit on their own. I could then begin to wrap the operations around a company that would present itself as a benefactor. But it is all still messy, and I really don't want to be caught committing fraud. Maybe the best way to execute the plan would be to disguise my intentions carefully.</p>

  <p>I should start at a reasonable place, the beginning to be more precise. I'll handle the logistics later. For now, I should focus on acquiring resources. As far as I've been able to understand, there are three types of resources required for an operation to work on a physical level.</p>

  <ol>
    
    <li>Economic resources</li>
    <li>Human resources</li>
    <li>Material resources</li>

  </ol>

  <p>All of these can be obtained on the basis of merit. And they can all be obtained through luck. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't the lovechild of some rich bundle of sticks, so I'll have to get my luck factory up and running if I want to get these.</p>

  <p>Of course, this is what we also know as getting things through merit. I have to make friends fast, and I don't really say it lightly. If I want this plan to succeed, I will have to get a hold of all the creative minds I can find and spike their interest in the project when I get the chance. This is a 3-day plan, so I'll have to handle things delicately.</p>

  <p>The day 1 mission will be to do scouting, as I have to know who to recruit and who to avoid for projects like these to work as they should. Programmers will hardly be necessary, as I plan on completing all the work necessary for completing that part of any games that are made. What I need are artists and musicians. Those guys and anybody with experience in gamedev will be necessary. As for publicity, I'll have to find someone who is more or less sociable to work as a loudsmouth for torunaments and game nights. </p>

  <p>Day 2 will be about getting to know these people better. Invite them to lunch, help them out and cater to their egos. This should come to a halt whenever they feel like they are getting enough attention. Mention a game in the making, but don't overdo it. Most people I've met seem to think of me as oddly competent. I'll have to be more educated if I want them to help me. The jokes will have to wait until I've known them for at least a week or so.</p>

  <p>On the third and final day of the plan, it'll be friday already. I need to get at least two people to join the project this day. And I have to make it seem like they own the project and I'm some sort of genie who came to grant programming wishes. Most people there buy that. And in case I find someone who is not guillible enough and is worth the effort, I'll have to do myself to recruit that person immediately. It is rare to find someone that aware nowadays. And it would be nice to have someone like that when thing seem bleak.</p>

  <p>All things said, I think a good project would be a fighting game, It should at least be enough to light a spark of curiosity in their minds. And once they get curious enough, I can get them to help. It's not that I expect them to be efficient, as it is more or less the fact that I'll be able to gain assets from them as a favour if I simply manage to be charismatic enough, and they'll gain a benefit I don't need from whatever is created. This will be difficult.</p>
