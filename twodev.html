    <p>This site is shit</p>

    <p>I'll try adding more navigation tools to it, this way, I won't have issues when I want to go to the next post, or the previous post. I've got to say, the solution I've come up with isn't any better than what I had already. Maybe I should keep it minimal for the sake of aesthetic value.</p>
    <p>I don't like how it looks, and this blog looked incredibly shitty already. I guess I'll have to try and get more creative, because there is just no fucking way for me to decide on what to do with these. I could change the position into an absolute value to have it just not be in front of the visitor every time they(I) want to read anything.</p>

    <p>Trying to better the site might have been a tad of a mistake on my part. Keeping it minimal was the way to go. Which is odd, because I had plans for renovations already. I'll just try to keep it looking like a part of the 2008 web.</p>

    <p>I'll be logging in some nim tests, as I'll be learning nim for the remainder of my vacation. I was guessing I would be able to work for money. But thanks to an abrupt change of plans, I haven't been able to find any work.</p>

    <p>Well, so this is a change of template. I'll try to make the best of it.</p>

    <p>This is hardly a development log, it's just trying to come up with something to make the site not look as shitty as it looks. I haven't even done any scripting for this. I'm going to nim asap.</p>
