    <p>I need work asap</p>

    <p>My efforts at learning a stack have been sporadic at best these last few days. I haven't been able to do shit due to circumstances that lie outside of my control.</p>

    <p>Right now, I'll be trying to encode any journal I might make. All this due to not being able to have a decent amount of privacy in here. The key is polyalphabetic, three rotations. That should be enough to keep any one of them at bay. They are not smart enough to break the code, at least of that I can be sure. </p>

    <p>On a lighter note, I think I'll finally be going to school again. I was hoping I could spend the most amount of time away from home, and this is an opportunity if I've ever seen one.</p>

    <p>I will have to try to get more money. It will be difficult to do without getting caught tho.</p>

    <p>My flawless plan of bullshitting my way through the market wasn't so perfect after all, I'll need real skills if I want to stand a chance in a trade so overpopulated.</p>

    <p>The new plan is completing different exercises and puzzles every day for a year until my commit history makes me feel like I've finally found this "grass" the normies talk so much about.</p>

    <p>Considering I don't have a clue of what I'm doing right now, I should stick to the classics. I'm going to go start my practice year using good 'ol php. And if I don't develop dementia halfway through, I'll know I have succeeded and am now able to suck my own wully.</p>

    <p>Maybe I should add a link to my github for, I'm guessing only two or three people are going to see this, but you have to show class regardless. Whoever it is, I have to present myself as if I were in the presence of her majesty's nose (If she still has a nose by now that is). This whole blog thing is actually helping me cope with not being able to take control of my current situation. And that is something I should not strive for. I'll eventually overdose in copium if I don't do something quick.</p>

    <p>I don't count these as commits. This is just an abherration I've disguised as a bunch of badly organised html files. </p>

    <p>What could be my first commit? Maybe I could try to make a CLI interface for a multitool script. I could have it make dumb stuff like generate passwords, encode words, kill random processes. I could also use it as a dashboard in case I have an IoT project that was actually worth making with how difficult it is for me to actually got buy pieces.</p>
