    <p>Magnus did nothing wrong</p>

    <p>I want to clarify. My intentions here are to put to words what I want to do in my day to day. And the magic ball said I need to install gentoo, so I'll have to obey the magic ball.</p>

    <p>Here's the plan: I'll ditch this endeavourOS install and use the disk space to install gentoo. The process might actually take me a day or so, which means I'll have to be smart about choosing the day.</p>

    <p>Or I could get a new computer, if I get a job. Which I actually want to do, but to do so would require my parents to approve of my job.</p>

    <p>So I can't get a decent job because they want me to be part of the family business instead. And the only other option is getting something nearby, but I only have small businesses nearby, and they don't want me to get a "Shitty job". Right now, I'm kind of fucking screwed.</p>

    <p>So I have a plan. My plan is to get into webdev and make money online. Let's sell my soul because holy shit I don't want to get involved in the family business.</p>

    <p>My plan is for them to not find out about this gig until I get enough money to move out for the period of at least one year. It should not take that long to save up. Keeping them in the dark about it will be the hard part, as js is a high level language on its own. I'll first need to learn a versatile stack, along with php for the making of a certain project of mine. I should be able to manage the time I'm given in these little spurts for development.</p>

    <p>I will try to get some donations in if I ever git gud at OS development. Although, I could get more in simply starting up a custom distro. I still want to explore more options in file management.</p>
